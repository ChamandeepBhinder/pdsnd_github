### Project Title
Udacity Project - Explore US Bikeshare Data & Post it on Github
Course - Programming of Data Science with Python

### Description
In this project, Python is used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the united state- Chicago, New york city, Washington. I am using my Bikeshare python file and .csv data files to post my work on Github. It provides an interactive experience for the users such that they can decide how to filter the data.

### Files used
Include the files used - Randomly selected data for all three cities in .csv format(chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv). all three of data files contain the same core eight columns: start time, end time, trip duration, start station, end station, user type, gender, birth year.
